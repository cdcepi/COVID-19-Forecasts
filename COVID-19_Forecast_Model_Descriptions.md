**Model name:** USC

**Intervention assumptions:** These projections assume that current interventions will not change during the forecasted period.

**Hospitalization assumptions:** The number of new hospitalizations per day are estimated from the number of infections.

**Methods:** SIR model

**Forecasts submitted:** Cases, hospitalizations, deaths


### [University of Texas, Austin](https://covid-19.tacc.utexas.edu/projections/) <a name="UT"/>

**Model name:** UT

**Intervention assumptions:** This model estimates the extent of social distancing using geolocation data from mobile phones and assumes that the extent of social distancing does not change during the period of forecasting. The model is designed to predict confirmed COVID-19 deaths resulting from only a single wave of transmission.

**Methods:** Nonlinear Bayesian hierarchical regression with a negative-binomial model for daily variation in death rates

**Forecasts submitted:** Deaths


### [University of Virginia](https://biocomplexity.virginia.edu/)<a name="UVA"/>

**Model name:** UVA

**Intervention assumptions:** There are two different assumptions influencing this ensemble model. Two of the three models assume that the effects of interventions are reflected in the observed data and will continue going forward, while the third model assumes that interventions will change in the future.

**Methods:** This forecast is an ensemble of three different models: An auto-regressive model, a machine learning (long short-memory) model, and a SEIR model.

**Forecasts submitted:** Cases


### [US Army Engineering Research and Development Center](https://github.com/erdc-cv19/seir-model/) <a name="ERDC"/>

**Model name:** ERDC

**Intervention assumptions:** These projections assume that current interventions will not change during the forecasted period.

**Hospitalization assumptions:** The number of new hospitalizations per day are estimated from the number of infections, using state-specific hospitalization rates.

**Methods:** SEIR model

**Forecasts submitted:** Cases, hospitalizations, deaths


### [Walmart Labs Data Science Team](https://github.com/ivan-ji-walmart/covid19-forecast-hub) <a name="Walmart"/>

**Model name:** Walmart

**Intervention assumptions:** These projections do not make any specific assumptions about which interventions have been implemented or will remain in place.

**Methods:** Logistic growth

**Forecasts submitted:** Deaths


### [Wadhwani AI](https://www.wadhwaniai.org/)<a name="Wadhwani"/>

**Model name:** Wadhwani

**Intervention assumptions:** These projections assume that current interventions will not change during the forecasted period.

**Methods:** Bayesian SEIR model

**Forecasts submitted:** Cases, deaths


### [Youyang Gu (COVID-Projections)](www.covid19-projections.com/) <a name="YYG"/>

**Model name:** YYG

**Intervention assumptions:** The model accounts for individual state-by-state re-openings and responses to increasing cases and their impact on infections and deaths.

**Methods:** SEIR model with machine learning for parameter estimation

**Forecasts submitted:** Deaths
